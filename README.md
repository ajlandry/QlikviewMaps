QlikviewMaps
============

Hey there!

I wanted to provide the community with some free extensions for mapping in QlikView.



#### Now Available

* **Leafletjs**

>Mapping extension based on LeafletJS framework, uses Google as the TileLayer and Leaflet Marker Cluster .  Plots markers on map given latitude and longitude.  Allows user to toggle between Road, Satille, and Hybird Google maps.



#### Coming Soon

* **Gmaps**

> Based on Gmap.js framework.  Allows for user to give addresses, cities or states and will geocode the address into lat and long automatically.
